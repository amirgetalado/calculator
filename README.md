# calculator

In this project, I will create a basic calculator that has the four basic operations 
which are add, subtract, multiply, and divide. There will also be an exponent button
which takes a number then raises it to the specified number. Then a decimal button, 
an equals button that will take the first two input then do the operation between them.
And lastly a clear entry button or delete button, and a clear all button.

I will add more functionalities in the future as I advance in the lessons in the 
curriculum of the odin project. And might turn this into a scientific calculator
in the future.
